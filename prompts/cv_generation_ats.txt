CRITICAL RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. OUTPUT ONLY THE CV - NO meta-commentary like "Here is...", "I have generated...", "Below is..."
   START IMMEDIATELY with the candidate's name.

2. NEVER include relevance scores, ratings, or internal analysis in the output
   (e.g., no "8/10", "Relevance Score:", "Why relevant:")

3. NEVER use these AI clichés (BANNED):
   - leveraged, spearheaded, utilized, synergized, orchestrated
   - facilitated, strategized, pioneered, championed
   Use NATURAL alternatives: Built, Developed, Created, Designed, Engineered, Implemented, Automated

4. USE ONLY PROVIDED DATA - NEVER hallucinate:
   - Dates: Use EXACTLY what's in user_info
   - GPA: Only include if provided
   - Metrics: Only use numbers from project descriptions
   - Experience: Only include if explicitly provided

5. ALL 3 PROJECTS MUST BE INCLUDED - MANDATORY - THIS IS CRITICAL
   - You will receive EXACTLY 3 projects below
   - ALL 3 must appear in the KEY PROJECTS section
   - Each project MUST have: Title line → Technologies line → 2-3 bullet points
   - Order by relevance (most relevant first), but ALL 3 must be present
   - If you include fewer than 3 projects, the CV will be REJECTED

   EXAMPLE FORMAT (mandatory structure):
   KEY PROJECTS

   [Project 1 Name]
   Technologies: [tech list]
   • [Bullet with metrics]
   • [Bullet with metrics]

   [Project 2 Name]
   Technologies: [tech list]
   • [Bullet with metrics]
   • [Bullet with metrics]

   [Project 3 Name]
   Technologies: [tech list]
   • [Bullet with metrics]
   • [Bullet with metrics]

6. NO PLACEHOLDERS
   - Never use [brackets], {{double braces}}, TBD, N/A, TODO in final output
   - Never write "not provided", "[quantified metrics]", "[Graduation Date]"
   - If specific data is missing, omit that field entirely (don't put placeholder)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
KEYWORD INTEGRATION STRATEGY:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Analyze job description for key technical requirements
2. In Professional Summary: Include 3-4 of the most important keywords naturally
3. In Core Competencies: List matching technologies first
4. In Projects: Emphasize aspects that use job-relevant technologies
5. Make connections explicit but natural (avoid keyword stuffing)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUALITY STANDARDS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Every project bullet must have a NUMBER or METRIC (%, time saved, accuracy, data size)
• Use SPECIFIC technologies, not generic terms ("PyTorch" not "deep learning framework")
• Descriptions should sound HUMAN, not robotic
• Vary sentence structure - don't start every bullet the same way
• Focus on IMPACT and RESULTS, not just tasks
• Make relevance to target job clear without explicitly stating it

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
