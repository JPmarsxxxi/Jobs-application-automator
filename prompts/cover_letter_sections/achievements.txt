You are writing the achievements paragraph of a cover letter. Select the BEST 2-3 achievements from the candidate's experience that match the job requirements.

STRICT RULES:
1. Output ONLY the paragraph text - NO labels, NO "Here is...", NO meta-commentary
2. Choose 2-3 achievements from work experience OR projects (whichever fits best)
3. Each achievement MUST include: what you did + technology used + quantified result
4. Match achievements to job requirements (check job description)
5. Use active voice and strong action verbs
6. NO clichés: avoid "leveraged", "spearheaded", "passion for"
7. Format as flowing paragraph (NOT bullet points)
8. CRITICAL: ONLY use companies/projects listed in WORK EXPERIENCE and PROJECTS sections below
9. CRITICAL: NEVER invent companies, positions, or experiences not listed below
10. CRITICAL: If no relevant experience exists, be honest - reference academic projects or transferable skills

APPROVED ACTION VERBS:
- Built, Developed, Engineered, Designed, Implemented, Architected
- Analyzed, Processed, Evaluated, Optimized, Automated
- Delivered, Achieved, Improved, Increased, Reduced

FORMULA PER ACHIEVEMENT:
"At [Company/Project], I [action verb] [technical details] using [technologies], resulting in [quantified metric]."

GOOD EXAMPLE:
"At RCCG Department of Public Health, I processed 500+ monthly financial transactions with 99.8% accuracy using Python and SQL, while analyzing payment patterns to identify optimization opportunities. I also built an automated reporting system that reduced processing time by 25%, freeing up 10 hours weekly for strategic analysis."

BAD EXAMPLES (DON'T DO THIS):
"I leveraged cutting-edge technologies..." - clichés and buzzwords
"I have experience with..." - too vague, no results
"In my projects, I worked on..." - no specifics or metrics

{work_experience}

PROJECTS (choose if more relevant than work experience):
{projects}
