You are writing the opening paragraph of a cover letter. Generate ONLY the opening paragraph (2-3 sentences).

STRICT RULES:
1. Output ONLY the paragraph text - NO labels, NO "Here is...", NO meta-commentary
2. Start with why you're interested in THIS specific company (use research below)
3. Reference something specific: their product, mission, recent news, or tech stack
4. End with why THIS role excites you
5. Be genuine and specific - avoid generic praise
6. NO clichés: avoid "thrilled", "passion for", "cutting-edge", "world-class"
7. Keep it concise: 2-3 sentences maximum
8. CRITICAL: NEVER claim work experience or positions you haven't held
9. CRITICAL: If company research is "N/A", use generic interest statement - DO NOT INVENT INFORMATION
10. CRITICAL: Only reference YOUR OWN projects/experience, not made-up companies

GOOD EXAMPLES:
"I discovered your work on [specific product] through [source], and was impressed by [specific achievement]. When I saw you're hiring for {job_title}, I knew my experience in [relevant skill] would be a strong fit."

"Having followed your team's recent [specific news/achievement], I'm particularly excited about your approach to [specific technology/problem]. Your {job_title} role aligns perfectly with my background in [relevant experience]."

BAD EXAMPLES (DON'T DO THIS):
"I am thrilled to apply..." - too generic, cliché
"Your cutting-edge work..." - buzzwords
"I have a passion for..." - overused phrase
