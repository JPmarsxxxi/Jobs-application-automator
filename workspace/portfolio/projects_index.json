      "description": "Multi-source sentiment analysis collecting data from Reddit, Telegram, YouTube, and Google News to predict Bitcoin price movements. Compared custom LSTM encoder (64.8% accuracy) against domain-specific CryptoBERT transformer. Key finding: sentiment is reactive, not predictive at hourly timeframes (52.9% vs 50.9% baseline). Demonstrates academic rigor in hypothesis testing and critical analysis of negative results.",

CNN processes article images (128x256) while LSTM analyzes captions. Implemented custom architectures with proper train/test splitting, multi-label classification (sigmoid activation), and comprehensive evaluation including per-class metrics and top-k predictions. Critical analysis identifies strengths of each modality.",
